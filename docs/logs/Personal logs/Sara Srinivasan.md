### Review

We have good team synergy and a shared line of thinking with enough diversity in skillset that I feel confident in our team's ability to work together. We had some issues with pushing directly to main by accident since we cant setup branch protection on a non enterprise private repo. Hopefully it shouldnt happen going forward
