## TO REVISIT IN TERM 2
- Enterprise Users and Bulk Analysis
- Image Processing

## Architecture Diagram Changes
- Review videos in Discord for info on NLM's
- Text Preprocessing will provide Bag of Words
- Instead of LLM, we are moving to pyLDAvis model in text analysis
- Insights generated by NLM
- Remove image processing for now, can add it back in later (want to watch our scope)
- Moving to Python over Java due to this new approach (easier to implement with this approach)
