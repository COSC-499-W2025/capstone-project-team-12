# January 26 2026

## To Do:
- Sara to live mount the entire database
- An working on requirement 25
- Devin -> Peer testing instructions/task list
- Maddy -> Contributor count bug, and add functions for storing/retrieving resumes, and Sara will actually store/retrieve the data 
- Lexi -> Controls parity (making all of the keys consistent) and refer to all "results" as analysis

## Notes:
- Everyone works on Q/A checks before peer testing to make sure that overall functionality is intact. Any bug fixes that need to be merged for peer testing need to be merged by Tuesday.
- Portfolios
  - Name of the project, context (who it was for, solo/team, etc), what it does (evidence of success), link to the repository
  - Writer's statements, and a selection of the writer's works. (Do we even include this?)
  - Any other types of portfolios we could add?
