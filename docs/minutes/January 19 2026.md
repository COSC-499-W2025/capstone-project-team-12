## Tasks This Week
- Lexi & Maddy -> Bug fix on the contributor stats for Mac users
- Devin, Sara, Sithara (?) ->
  - Sara is working on the DB to check the differences between different versions (?)
  - Devin is refactoring the database functions
- Devin -> Req 23, add a menu of the possible things you can edit, rather than the sequential setup they created from last week.
- Lexi -> Find a better way to identify frameworks/skills from import lines than the current regex pattern matching.
- Maddy -> customize wording for the resume. Also look in to potential alternatives for PyDriller in case that is the issue with Mac users.
- Everyone -> Think about what evidence of success looks like for a given project (Req 25)


## Notes:
- Lexi Local LLM failing when Local is selected
  - Devin will change LLM to a stable version (hopefully that is part of the issue) -> Currently on his branch
- We need to look at how we want the portfolio to be structured and what should be included in it. Milestone 3 has some insights, but we wanted to confirm with everyone.
 

## Next Week:
- Refactor LLM data to include project data in the prompt to give more context on the projects themselves. Sending the full thing may be too much; maybe be selective of which projects get sent.
- Could refactor collaborators to calculate based on the names rather than the emails to ensure no duplicates are counted. Leaving for next week in case we need to use a different library entirely.
