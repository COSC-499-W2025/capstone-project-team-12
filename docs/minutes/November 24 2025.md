# November 24, 2025 Meeting
The initial meeting was highly focused on establishing the basics of the team contract to ensure that we have all key points in place before formalizing it.
This contract submission is due December 7.

## For This Week - Integration Week
- Update main.py -> Sithara
  - Prompting the user for the right input and ensuring the output is correct
- Text/Code Pre-processor. Work together and into PII -> Sara & Maddy
  - Connecting the two
  - Determining the output
  - Code Pre-Processor testing 
- Compiling and saving to the database -> Devin
  - Could add a saving module for this
  - Save the insights, BoW, topic vector, etc
  - Saving and retrieving these pieces
- Making sure the metadata pipeline output in main.py is coming out correctly -> An
- Update the return from Project Analysis to separate the data from the calculated insights -> Maddy
- Implement the import readings, skills timeline -> Lexi
- Submit the slides for Sunday -> Whoever has time (Can be later in the week)

## Presentation Planning
- What our architecture is and why we chose to do it this way (Docker containers and why we did them)
  - Our software pipelines and how they work
  - Breakdowns of the pipelines and how they work
  - Image of the overall outputs and the data used to determine them -> Specifically wants the Non-LLM (ie the local LLM alternative) insights
    - Note that the analysis is handled without the local LLM, and the only return is the NL portion of the insights
  - Focus on the process (brief overview) and then finish with a quick touch on the outputs
    - Planning to utilize these overall insights for visualizations in the later steps
   
## For Next Milestone
- We will need to differentiate between the resume insights and portfolio insights

## For Next Week
- Video creation for demonstration
- Any last-minute changes needed for the MVP
