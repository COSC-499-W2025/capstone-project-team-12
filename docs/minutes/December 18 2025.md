# December 18, 2025 Meeting Minutes
## Plans For Term 2
- Testing is mainly unit testing, but we need to beef up the integration testing
- Refactor and clean up main.py
  - Separate into more classes (files) -> similar to the project printing stuff
  - Fix the looping logic -> ensure it only ends when the user selects to close the program
- Scale the number of topics extracted based on file size (rather than always doing 5)
- Implement a way to check for duplicate files that have been parsed -> use checksum
- Project analysis file refactor -> needs clean up

## During the Break
- Refactor the 2 clients for the LLM into 1 for simplicity -> Devin
  - Potentially some testing
- May try to get some refactoring -> Maddy
