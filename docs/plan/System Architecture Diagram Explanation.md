# Software Architecture Explanation

- In our software architecture diagram, the User interacts with a local browser interface that lets them select files for analysis, check for errors, and view previously generated results and provide/change user settings. 

- When a user selects files, the File Manager reads those files directly from the computer's operating system. The files are then sent to two modules: a Metadata Extractor, which gathers details like file type, size, and last modified date, and a File Classifier, which determines if each file is source code or text. 

From the File Classifier, content split into two processing pipelines: 

1. **Code pre-process** pipeline, which extracts identifiers using Pygments and breaks the code into tokens, and a **Text Preprocess** pipeline, which standardizes text for analysis by splitting it into tokens, dropping filler words, lemmatizing them and removing any personally identifiable information. 

2. The cleaned text is then stored in a Bag-of-Words (BoW) model with a built-in cache to avoid reprocessing. The BoW is then fed into the Text Analysis component, where a topic identification model produces topic vectors and statistics. 

- In parallel, the Project Analysis module examines the repository itself. It reads data from the project's Git history and scans import statements and package files to measure contributions and use of dependencies. 

- The raw data is saved to a Database table and 

These results are combined with the Text Analysis and Metadata statistics outputs into a single bundle of vectors and statistics, which is then passed to the Insights Generator and also saved to a **Pre-Analysis** aka **Tracked Data** Database table.

- In this stage, the Insights Generator creates two forms of output: summaries generated by an LLM or a rule-based template (depending on user settings), and visual charts generated with an HTML Grapher. This data is saved to seperate ''

The past two databases are linked with a foreign key that allows each insight to be traced back to the set of data it was created from allowing the user to make incremental changes.

Finally, the Dashboard Generator compiles these into an interactive HTML page output. Finally, The user can also export the dashboard as a static .docx or .pdf file.
