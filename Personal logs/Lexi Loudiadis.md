# Lexi Loudiadis (93546844) Personal Log

## Week 8 (10/20/2025 - 10/26/2025)

- Coded the main.py method
- Refactored the validate_path() logic
- Wrote unit tests for the validate_path() method

### In Progress

- Adding more logic to main as it what we're using to handle interaction between different classes for Milestone 1. So we need to keep connecting it to different classes/methods as they become available. For next week this is likely connnecting it to Text Preprocessor, our newly refactored File Classifier and our newly added Code Preprocessor. 

### What's Next
- Some more refactoring, establishing testing, var/func name standards, type declarations, etc
- Implementing our PII remover so the Text Preprocessing pipleine is fully completed
