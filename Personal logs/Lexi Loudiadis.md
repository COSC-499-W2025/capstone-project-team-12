## Week 9 (10/27/2025 - 11/02/2025)

- Researched for the PII Remover
- Coded the PII Remover
- Wrote local and unit tests for the PII remover
- Reviewed teammates' PRs
- Participated in team meetings 

### What's Next
- TBD but we will likely keep making progress on the metadata analysis pipeline that was started this week. Additionally some of us may also start working on the text analysis pipeline using a ML model. We also will have to make the corresponding changes to our main method to ensure that we can run our existing pipelines from it.

## Week 8 (10/20/2025 - 10/26/2025)

- Coded the main.py method
- Refactored the validate_path() logic
- Wrote unit tests for the validate_path() method

### In Progress

- Adding more logic to main as it what we're using to handle interaction between different classes for Milestone 1. So we need to keep connecting it to different classes/methods as they become available. For next week this is likely connnecting it to Text Preprocessor, our newly refactored File Classifier and our newly added Code Preprocessor. 

### What's Next
- Some more refactoring, establishing testing, var/func name standards, type declarations, etc
- Implementing our PII remover so the Text Preprocessing pipleine is fully completed
