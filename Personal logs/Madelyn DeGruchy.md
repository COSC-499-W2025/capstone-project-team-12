# Madelyn DeGruchy Personal Log (85064962 - maddydeg)
## Week 7 (10/13/2025 - 10/19/2025)
- Implemented the helper methods isCode() and isText() for classifying files
- Collaborated on the file classifier
- Wrote testing for helper methods

### In Progress
- Working on refactoring the file classifier to consider the full node passed from the tree -> this changes current checks from strings to the full node
- Will need to fully refactor testing, current implementations are very string-specific

### For Next Week
- Discuss refactoring of tree processing as it changes how it passes a full node object instead of just the name (string)
- Add issues for the rest of Milestone 1, discuss further task assignments with the group
