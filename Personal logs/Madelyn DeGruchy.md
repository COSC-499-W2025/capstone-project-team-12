# Madelyn DeGruchy Personal Log (85064962 - maddydeg)
## Week 8 (10/20/2025 - 10/26/2025)
- Refactored _isCode() and _isText() to match the refactor of the attributes structure of file nodes in the file manager
- Added new helper method _getExtension() to retrieve the extension of the node passed from the tree processor
- Refactored testing of the file classifier for parity with file manager node attribute structure, including new MockNode() helper method
- Assisted in troubleshooting the validate-main-test branch, where a test directory and file could not be committed to the repo
- Took part in team discussions to determine tasks for the week
### For Next Week
- We will be meeting on Monday to set out next week's issues, and to plan some additional issues to be assigned to be prepared for the coming weeks
- Further research PyDriller to be prepared to begin the metadata analysis pipeline.

## Week 7 (10/13/2025 - 10/19/2025)
- Implemented the helper methods isCode() and isText() for classifying files
- Collaborated on the file classifier
- Wrote testing for helper methods

### In Progress
- Working on refactoring the file classifier to consider the full node passed from the tree -> this changes current checks from strings to the full node
- Will need to fully refactor testing, current implementations are very string-specific

### For Next Week
- Discuss refactoring of tree processing as it changes how it passes a full node object instead of just the name (string)
- Add issues for the rest of Milestone 1, discuss further task assignments with the group
