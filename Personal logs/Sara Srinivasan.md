### Review and Future Plans

Very productive week for me, i'd argue it makes up for last week's absence (though that was for medical reasons...)

One of our dependencies (SpaCy) is broken due to upstream changes, I've volunteered to investigate and fix the issue or alternatively find an alternative library.

This will require a full rewrite of one of our text_processing module. Which I am likely to handle next week as well

We found the current agreed upon coding style standards to be inadequate so we're planning to discuss a full rework
of our code base next week to bring all components into alignment

A conversation I will likely lead, with that all of our preprocessing components are done.
We should be well positioned to get into ML driven Analysis in Week 10

## Week 7

- Made minor updates to Github Project.

### Review

We have good team synergy and a shared line of thinking with enough diversity in skillset that I feel confident in our team's ability to work together. We had some issues with pushing directly to main by accident since we cant setup branch protection on a non enterprise private repo. Hopefully it shouldnt happen going forward
