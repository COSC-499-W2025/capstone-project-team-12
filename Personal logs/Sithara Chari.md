### Review
Overall this week we mainly focused on refactoring our existing code, so we have everything we need moving forward. I couldn't get all the refactoring done for this week, so more will be happing in the following sprint.

### Future Plans
- refactor the nodes further: instead of storing binary data in the nodes directly, store in an array and have the index in the node
- add pytests for file_manager

## Week 9

### Work Done

- Attended and participated in team meeting for plans for this week
- Added types to all function parameters and return variables for easy error handling
- Stored binary data in a separate array instead of in the nodes itself for lighter data 
- added a function to be able to retrieve binary array without calling file manager again 
- Reviewed and requested changes for peers' PRs
- Refactored attribute names so they are consisten across class

### Review and future plans

- Was also supposed to do testing for file manager, but I was not able to get that done this week so it will probably be pushed to next week 
- Next week we also make our own custom nodes separately, as it is now done in file_manager itself which is doesn't make much sense 


## Week 10
## TODOs
- File manager testing (issue #92)
- get consent from user to access their files
- start processing bag of words (BOW) to generate topic vectors with pyLDAvis ML model 

### Work Done

### Review and future plans 
- This week I was really busy with my midterms, so I only was able to do the file manager testing and not any of the other work I was supposed to do
