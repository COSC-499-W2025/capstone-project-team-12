### Review
Overall this week we mainly focused on refactoring our existing code, so we have everything we need moving forward. I couldn't get all the refactoring done for this week, so more will be happing in the following sprint.

### Future Plans
- refactor the nodes further: instead of storing binary data in the nodes directly, store in an array and have the index in the node
- add pytests for file_manager
