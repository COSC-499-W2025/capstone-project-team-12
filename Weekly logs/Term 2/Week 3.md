### In Progress
- The database refactor to support the requirements of Milestone 2
- Getting ready for peer testing, including finalizing our task list and ensuring all of our environments are identical

### Upcoming plans
- Start working on incremental file addition
- Continue to work on milestone 2

### Reflections
- This week was a big refactoring/debugging week for us. Most team members worked to improve/add upon our existing functionality instead of adding completely new features. It seemed that we made good progress this week despite being down a member.
