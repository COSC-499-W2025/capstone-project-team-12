### Work Done
- Reworked file classifier and tree processor - among other things, our file classifier and metadata analyzer now use Pygments for language classification
- Designing a new database schema
- Started refactoring the database, beginning with updating the whole database manager to handle the new database schema
- Refactored and improved upon our imports/framework extractor to make it much more accurate and expanded its capability
- Debugging the project analysis pipeline
- Implemented a resume editing feature

Filtered to only show Tasks with changes this week. We had to use this format due to issues not linking to dates in "Completed Tasks".

### Test Report

### In Progress
- The database refactor to support the requirements of Milestone 2
- Getting ready for peer testing, including finalizing our task list and ensuring all of our environments are identical

### Upcoming plans
- Start working on incremental file addition
- Finish project debug work
- Continue to work on milestone 2

### Reflections
- This week was a big refactoring/debugging week for us. Most team members worked to improve/add upon our existing functionality instead of adding completely new features. It seemed that we made good progress this week despite being down a member and having another member's PR not get merged to main.
